# Run Rabbit Run

Hey there! This repository is the love child of an old Rails project and a newfound necessity for Javascript. This app allows you to _take note_ of all those little thoughts in your head and then sort them by category, or tag. She's built with support from Webpack, Sass, and Jest, and Hapi.


## Running the Project

For the most part, you'll be running `npm run dev`. This command will run your project in development mode on your local machine at <http://localhost:8080>. Running in development mode will automatically update your project in the browser using [hot module replacement][Webpack-HotModule] without _actually_ reloading the project. This means you can make change to your code and see the results quickly.
